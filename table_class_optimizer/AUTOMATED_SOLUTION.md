## Overview
Note: Actual costs may vary based on your AWS usage and the scale of your DynamoDB deployments.

The automated solution utilizes customer usage data from Athena CUR queries and operates as a serverless solution using Lambda, Step Functions, EventBridge, and Amazon SES. The solution is designed to scale and can be implemented by any customer directly from the DynamoDB Tools in the AWS Labs repository.

## Solution Architecture
<img width="608" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f56677cb-dc0d-4f5d-83cd-9f3b957b239e" />

The automated system workflow:

1. EventBridge triggers the workflow monthly (configurable schedule)
2. Step Function initiates the optimization process:
   - Retrieves the Athena named query
   - Executes the query against CUR data
   - Processes results through Lambda
3. Athena pulls data from the CUR database
4. Lambda function:
   - Analyzes query results for optimization opportunities
   - Updates table classes (if ExecuteRecommendations enabled)
   - Generates detailed CSV report
5. SES delivers the report to specified recipients

## Cost Estimation

Monthly operational costs for the automated system (approximate):

- Lambda execution: < $0.10
  - One execution per month
  - Typical runtime < 1 minute
- Step Functions: < $0.05
  - One state machine execution per month
- Athena query: $0.20-1.00
  - Depends on CUR data volume
  - Typically processes 1-6 months of data
- SES: Free tier eligible
  - One email per month with CSV attachment
- Total estimated cost: < $2.00 per month

Note: Actual costs may vary based on your AWS usage and the scale of your DynamoDB deployments.

## Design Considerations

The automated solution is distributed as a single CloudFormation Template file to allow for easy distribution, such as via a [quick-create link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stacks-quick-create-links.html). The SQL query and Lambda Function code are inlined into the Template, while the query [DDB_TableClassReco.sql](DDB_TableClassReco.sql) remains as a separate file for independent use or modification.

The project contains a [raw_template.yaml](raw_template.yaml) template file as the foundation. The Python script [generate_cloud_formation.py](generate_cloud_formation.py) takes the [lambda_handler.py](lambda_handler.py) and [DDB_TableClassReco.sql](DDB_TableClassReco.sql) files and inlines them into the raw_template.yaml to produce `template.yaml`.

The resulting `template.yaml` can be deployed to CloudFormation in a management account that has access to query the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) files and also has permission to create a CloudFormation StackSet (containing an IAM Role for performing the Table Class updates) in the target accounts that have the DynamoDB tables.

## Troubleshooting

### Q1: Why am I not seeing any CUR data in my Athena queries?
A1: This could be due to several reasons:
- CUR may not be properly configured in your AWS account.
- The Athena table might not exist or is not up to date.
- The AthenaCURDatabase and AthenaCURTable parameters in your configuration might be incorrect.

To resolve:
1. Verify CUR is set up correctly in your AWS account.
2. Check if the Athena table exists and contains recent data.
3. Ensure the database and table names in your configuration match those in Athena.

### Q2: I'm encountering permission errors. What should I check?
A2: Permission issues often stem from incorrect IAM configurations:
1. Review the IAM roles and policies for the Lambda function and Step Functions.
2. Verify that AWS Organizations access is properly set up.
3. If using multiple accounts, ensure cross-account roles are correctly configured.
4. Check that the executing role has necessary permissions for Athena, S3, and DynamoDB.

### Q3: Why aren't my optimization report emails being delivered?
A3: Email delivery issues can be caused by:
- Incorrect SES configuration
- Unverified sender or recipient email addresses
- SES sending limits

To troubleshoot:
1. Confirm SES is set up correctly in your account.
2. Verify that the sender email address is verified in SES.
3. Check if recipient email addresses are correct and verified (if required).
4. Review your SES sending limits and request increases if necessary.

### Q4: The optimizer isn't generating any recommendations. What could be wrong?
A4: This could be due to:
- A MinimumSavings threshold that's set too high
- Incorrect specification of AccountIds, PayerIds, TableNames, or RegionNames
- Insufficient historical data in the CUR for meaningful analysis

Try the following:
1. Lower the MinimumSavings threshold in your configuration.
2. Verify that the AccountIds, PayerIds, TableNames, and RegionNames parameters are correct.
3. Ensure you have at least 1-3 months of data in your CUR.

### Q5: My Athena query is timing out. How can I resolve this?
A5: For large datasets, Athena queries might time out. To address this:
1. Reduce the `months_to_scan` parameter in the SQL query.
2. Optimize your Athena table (e.g., partition the table, convert to Parquet format).
3. Consider breaking down the analysis into smaller chunks (e.g., by account or region).

### Q6: I see unexpected table class changes in my DynamoDB tables. What's happening?
A6: This could occur if:
- The ExecutionMode is set to 'ReportAndExecute' instead of 'ReportOnly'
- There are other processes or people modifying table classes

To address:
1. Check the ExecutionMode parameter in your configuration. Set it to 'ReportOnly' if you don't want automatic changes.
2. Review the generated report for the rationale behind each recommendation.
3. Implement change management processes to control table class modifications.

### Q7: How can I get more detailed error information for troubleshooting?
A7: For more in-depth error details:
1. Check CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function for specific error messages.
2. Review the Step Functions execution history for a detailed breakdown of each step.
3. Enable DEBUG level logging in the Lambda function for more verbose output.

### Q8: The optimizer recommendations don't align with my expectations. What should I do?
A8: If recommendations seem off:
1. Review the SQL query parameters (e.g., `months_to_scan`, `min_savings_per_month`) to ensure they align with your optimization goals.
2. Check if there have been recent significant changes in your DynamoDB usage patterns that might not be reflected in historical data.
3. Consider adjusting the `cost_type` parameter if you're using special pricing or discounts.
